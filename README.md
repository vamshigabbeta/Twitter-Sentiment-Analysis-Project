# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment. Here i used Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier because  target  is a binary classification problem.
